        <p class="text-lg font-medium text-white">
          Exo (Korean: 엑소;) is a South Korean boy band based in Seoul formed
          by SM Entertainment in 2011 and debuted in 2012. The group consists of
          nine members: Xiumin, Suho, Lay, Baekhyun, Chen, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai
          and Sehun. They are noted for releasing music and performing
          extensively in Korean, Mandarin and Japanese.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg font-medium text-white">
          The group debuted with twelve members separated into Exo-K (Suho,
          Baekhyun, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai and Sehun) and Exo-M (Xiumin, Lay, Chen,
          Kris, Luhan and Tao). Members Kris, Luhan, and Tao departed the group
          individually amid legal battles with SM Entertainment in 2014 and
          2015. Exo-K and Exo-M performed music in Korean and Mandarin,
          respectively, until the release of their third EP Overdose in 2014.
          Since then, Exo have exclusively performed as one group, although
          their music continues to feature multiple languages. Members Chen,
          Baekhyun, and Xiumin debuted in the sub-unit Exo-CBX in 2016, and
          members Sehun and Chanyeol began promoting as the sub-unit Exo-SC in
          2019. Each member also maintains solo careers in music, film and
          television

        <p class="text-lg font-medium text-white">
          The group's later works expanded on their early commercial success,
          with their subsequent Korean studio albums combined with their
          repackages each selling over one million copies. They have been
          labeled "Nation's Pick" by the Korea Tourism Organization and by some
          as the "Kings of K-pop". Outside of music, the group members have
          endorsed brands such as Nature Republic and Samsung and participate in
          philanthropic efforts such as Smile For U, an ongoing project by SM
          Entertainment and UNICEF that began in 2015.
